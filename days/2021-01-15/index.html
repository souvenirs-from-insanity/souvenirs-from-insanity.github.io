                Preamble
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
It was our first time. I would go first.
        <br >
        
At the end of the day he said 
        <q >
                    It would be really weird if I didn't get to take it tomorrow
        </q>
        .
I didn't understand.
        <br >
        

        <q >
                    Well, now that I've seen what it had done to you. ...And I would be left without the experience. Just having seen you...
        </q>
        

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
I had a pretty heavy breakfast. Didn't want to go on an empty stomach. A ham and melted cheese sandwich, or maybe it was
french toast, I don't remember at this point. I finally arrived to K's place. I opened the pouch that I got as a gift and
there was four really small aluminium foil cubes. I picked what I considered a bigger one, even though they were probably all the same size.
I unwraped it and there was a completely normal looking sugar cube, just smaller than the one that you would imagine. I put it
in my mouth and cringed at the sweet flavor of sugar.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
Now what? We knew it would take time so we just started playing video games, which I didn't particularly enjoy.
K was very supportive, continously offering other activities. He didn't seem particularly excited or interested, he just accepted the day
with his usual patience of an old man.

                Birth
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
As the drug started to take effect, the importance of it hit me. I started to realize how much I underestimated what big
of a deal this was. I felt intimacy. Suddenly the event felt as important as attending the birth of someone's firstborn.
And I showed up in flip-flops. What was worse, K seemed calm and confident, like he knew exactly what we were getting
into. I knew I fucked up.

                The fabric of reality
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
The guts were first. The body knew something was not right.
I could feel my body slowly detaching from me. As if I were uncomfortable in my own skin. I knew the toilet is outside of scope at that moment. I just accepted that, Maybe ... I'm gonna pee myself on K's couch. The senses were just not connected the way they usually are. Which of the signals is my digestive tract and which one is my heart? or my arm?
For the rest of the day I would talk about my body in third person. "The body" is a huge pain in the ass. It was like a younger brother that you have to keep an eye on in kindergarden or a friend that had alcohol for the first time at this party and now it's your responsibility.

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
Fourty minutes in I knew something was happening.
The stomach has been weird for a while now, but it was at this moment that I looked at the carpet and it was special.
I turned and I could see 
        <em >
                    into
        </em>
         the painting on the wall.
I could 
        <em >
                    feel
        </em>
         as if the texture of the painting was extending beyond the frame.
Everything was made of the same 
        <i >
                    "fabric"
        </i>
        .

      <p >
                
A few moments later my vision would start to literally shake and peel apart like it was pieces of glass or torn newspaper. Reality was struggling to hold together.

                The look of disgust
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
I would often try to say something to K, but I would get lost in the idea. At some point he looked at me weird. I understood that
the rest of the journey I should be on my own.

      </p>
      

      <p class="sidenote">
                
He later explained that I would start a sentence, pause for 20 minutes, and try to resume the sentence at which point he lost context and didn't know how to react - hence the weird face. To me the sentence was continuous.

                Coming back
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
Around 18:00 I started being able to communicate again. There was so much to say, yet everything was so complex. I would try to draw diagrams of ideas.
I knew that I've already forgotten a lot. Millions of years have passed after all. But there was "a memory". I knew that once back in reality, none of this would make sense anymore, but I was wondering if taking it again I would have the memories of this first experience or if it would be a fresh start (something like a second identity that is preserved within you but invisible). I managed to express it as a diagram where your mind changes with arrows and it has two worlds to move between. The second point in the sober world represents a different starting point. Even if you can't tell the difference sober, going back in, you will end up elsewhere so the information would be preserved. I was trying to express something that "hides" a change of state.

                A hyperbolic multiverse
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
In the first few hours I would look into the void and navigate alternate universes. They were all connected, and there was a distinct sliding motion involved in transitioning between them. It was close to what you see in 
        <a alt="Miegakure: a 4D game" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yW--eQaA2I">
                    visualizations of 4D spaces
        </a>
         but you would slowly align your coordinates like a hyperbola approaching the "x" axis. The motion felt more like a slide of a glider (plane) than the rotation-like movement in Miegakure. Almost like an "ease-in" motion. When you were fully alligned you were at a meeting point, the intersection of two universes. It felt a bit like those parking lanes in front of american hotels where the car arrives on a curved path. And just when the world of the passenger aligns with the entrance of the hotel, you'd then switch to a different car and take off on a slightly different curve. K later nicknamed them "lobbies".

      <p >
                
The spaces had a looping feel to them. In the sense that I always knew how to get to another lobby from anywhere. Every point had a short path to any other. Just like how in 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry">
                    spherical spaces
        </a>

        .

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
When navigating those universes, the only thing that was always true was 
        <em >
                    me
        </em>
        . An 
        <i >
                    "I"
        </i>
         in the sense described by Descartes. A little devil WAS drawing a fake universe in my eyes and I turned it off. And exactly how he predicted, the only thing that remained was 
        <em >
                    me
        </em>
        . Just a stream of thoughts, a soul, whatever you wanna call it. It was a &#120793; from Math, it was the soul in budhism, it was God for white philosophers. Just one thing that doesn't change when everything else does.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
It was hard. For the first time I didn't see our brain like a machine in an environment. An environment that could exist without this negligible sensor.
It was me, a point. Navigating this infinite fabric of experiences. The universe was just two things. A soul and and this fish-net like material that it can navigate. For the first time in my life I felt this openness to religion.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
As the day went on I realized K had to be a second soul. It took time to accomodate for it. Late in the evening we watched "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas" it was all fine until Johny Depp broke the fourth wall and talked into the camera. He obviously had to be a third soul. The next day my illustration of the universe had 3 souls and a net-like fabric.

      </p>

      </div>
      

      <p >
                
In the evening discussions, it seemed obvious to me that me not knowing what is behind the walls (it was my first time at K's place) played a crucial role in my brain having this freedom to create a universe outside of it. I remember I would always return to this one lobby where the body was and I would picture this single room with two people inside and a black void around it. The room had a window, with a beatiful view, but it was somehow not limiting.

      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
"van Gogh!" I exclaimed. 
        <q >
                    Can you show me pictures from van Gogh?
        </q>
         K started playing a slideshow of impressionist painters on the TV. Maybe it was just Monet. In the 27 years of my life not once I looked at a painting and got something out of it. Here for the first time, I was immersed. I would be hooked for hours. It was beautiful. Every new picture was a new world. I could smell the trees. Hear the silence of the woods. The laughter of society. The freshness that comes with the spring. There was the pain of a poor childhood. Cold homes. Poverty and progress. The sea. So many views of the sea.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
Do people pretend? Were all artists always on this drug? Do they all have a brain deformity that causes the same condition as I have right now? K is supposed to be an artist, but I knew I just experienced art like he never has. 
        <q >
                    I know you're supposed to be closer to art than I am, but I can tell you, you people don't understand art.
        </q>
        . I knew exactly just how smug it was of me, but it was true. People have no idea how much beauty there is in art.

 The dark picture of a house had a really strong sadness in it. It was as if Charlie from the Chocolate factory grew in the neighborhood of Sweeney Todd. The street was really empty. As if the people left the city.

                The unlearning
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
I remember feeling like switches of knowledge were deactivated. There was a discrete sense of "gained knowledge". Like a pile of boxes. Each gained whenever you learned something. From the moment you were born. "You just realized this thing that hangs off of your body is YOUR hand?" Boop! One box for you. "You got hit in the nose and you feel that burning sensation in your eyes?" Another box appears. Each box on the pile means that whenever you open the entrance door from your building you don't open your eyes and wait to see what awaits you excited to gain another box. No. You open the door and the box is already there. Your body knows exactly what to do. Exactly what will happen. It has been done before. 

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
I felt like this pile of boxes was gone. Not just that, but I could see the graph that counted them explode at the point where I was born. Just like the tangent function that flies to infinity I felt this unmeasurable freedom of perception. It was this lookout for the unexpected that made the art what it was. This is what removed all the axioms from our existence and I could navigate universes where my eyes were not necessary.

      </p>

                This strong connection of a discrete amount that was "extendable" in the sense of a continuous function reminded me a lot of discrete elliptic curves in cryptography.

      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
In this universe that I just discovered it was all one. My eyes started to fill with tears. The act of expression and curiosity here become a single game. Everything bears an experience. Every experience can be put into words. As a child I would eat cereal for breakfast and I would build a three-piece wall around my bowl. Box of milk on the left, the cereal box with a bunny on the front and the plastic bag with the cereal itself formed the last piece. Then I could eat in my own environment. I stopped doing that at some point. The feeling that I got out of it was gone. But here, here everything is like that. You know how when you enter a café and you have to pick a place to sit? "Not this one, it's too close to the door. This one is too much in the dark. Here I would be back to back with that weird couple." LSD takes all those invisible senses that you have and makes them the same class of things as a tax statement. It lifts them into this world of ours. It's because of this that a weird smirk on you friend's face can change the taste of the strawberry that you're eating right now.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
Every single bit of knowledge that you've ever gained is like a spice or a pigment that you brought with yourself. It was at this moment that I realized that I found MY drug. Right there, it felt like no other would ever be needed. At some point in the future K noted that I would probably love a book he read. It was called "The glassbead game", about a comunity of people playing a game of unclear rules involving many arts and sciences.

                The layers
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
As the experience was changing I started to classify it. Later in the day I would think of it as of an onion. You always transition between neighboring layers. At first you experience Layer 1.
      </p>
      

      <p >
                
Layer 1 is like weed or alcohol. An enhanced perception of your existence. On this stage already art becomes a different experience. Instead of the tingling of the rain that you get when you look outside a train window, it's more like jumping into a pool and feeling it enclose your body and every single bit of you becomes wet. You can feel the weight of the whole pool on your chest. For a moment you just feel the bubbles flowing around your skin, everything else is ignored. And then you're in it. Water everywhere. Moving your limbs involves a feeling of warm, butter-like currents flowing around them.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
Layer 2 is themed experiences. You can focus on anything. And it will gain importance as a fundamental law of your universe. Your experience will revolve around it. It's like cartoons or theme parks.
Is this a pirate-themed rollercoaster? Well the seats better look like barrels. Have you just thought of world events? Time will pause, the world will fade in color and start looking like a newspaper page. People will become journalists. The silence is the one that follows a bomb explosion. You see the dust of war in the air. It all starts with a single association that paints the rest of the world.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
Layer 3 is just a stream of thoughts. The "I" is lost. Humanity is no more. Planets? Pff. Time does not exist here. Causality neither. It's like a Prolog database of facts. An infinite library of things that are true and you can navigate it, put pieces together. You can spend millions of years here.
It never felt like the line of thought paused at any moment, but in layer 3, the thought process is 
        <i >
                    "denser"
        </i>
        .
One second of thought can fit the timeline from the dinosaurs to us.

      </p>

I would later try to compare this with K. He had no idea what I was talking about. He said he had nothing like Layer 3 happen to him. But he was silent for most of his experience. I wouldn't be surprised if he just forgot. After all I would often remember five minute old centuries like you remember the day you learned to ride a bike.

I remember trying to talk about the universes that I saw. And the thoughts would often roll "into themselves". I knew there was something infinite about it. It felt like a "set of all sets" kind of situation or infinite data structures where you accidentaly trigger a non-terminating evaluation sequence. This kind of pattern arised in different aspects of the experience. I remember the timeline feeling like this even though I can't reason about it anymore. Memories were like this. I would many times have a feeling of Dejavu but looking into the memory would trigger an infinite loop. After a few of those I would realize that the memory was maybe of what was happening right now. Maybe it comes from the future. Can I remember things that haven't happened yet? Can the recollection of an event happen within that event?

Days later I woke up and remembered the key that I saw in a dream. In software, whenever we have some program, we need to run it on a computer typically a processor. Once we started having different processors we realized we can write "emulators" i.e. programs that recreate the behavior of a different processor. They can take a program written for a different processor and trick it into thinking it's running on the processor it was written for. Basically you have your program, i.e. software, running on software. The dream was of a universe that was "emulating" itself. What if there is no processor at the bottom? Just a loop of an emulator interpreting itself.

was impossible. I would look outside the window, focus on the street lights and see cat faces made out of precious rocks. This cat had charisma. They could make a hip-hop star out of it. I imagined all the merchandise and the tv adds. The catchy 90's music to sell it.

I woke up the next morning and I was fresh as if it never happened. I could not believe we regularly face the next-day consequences of alcohol when "strong drugs" leave "no trace". It felt like a dream.
But it wasn't. It was K's turn.
