      <h2 >
                A new life
      </h2>
      


      <p >
                
It's been exactly a month since the first time. Life is different, especially the first days.
I felt like what I imagine normal people feel. There was more color. A morning represented the start of something again.
Paintings meant nothing to me again, but this time I had a memory. I felt like a person that lost sight. A memory of light
was daring me. I was looking forward to this monday. K couldn't join me and it would be long before he would be available again, but I wanted back to Narnia.

      <h2 >
                The unknown
      </h2>
      


      <p >
                I was a bit scared. I didn't know what are the challenges of being alone.
      </p>
      

      <p >
                
In 40 minutes I felt that uncomfortable feeling on the stomach, as if every neuron in it was being tingled.
I would message my brother, to have at least someone connected to reality.
The chat app was incredibly colorful. I started listening to Funkadelic and I realized I would enjoy the most the songs that I usually skip.

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
The apartment is a historic building that doesn't hold heat well. It was really hard to know if I was too hot or too cold. I put on a hoodie and sat under a blanket.
Most of the day was a fight. I felt like one of those old bearded men in books about their fight against the elements. I soon started to feel a pain on my liver.
Maybe a consequence of the mononucleosis that I suffered last year? I knew this experience wouldn't be free so I just accepted my fate.

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
I remember looking outside the window without the slightest feeling of happiness, yet an incredible feeling of beauty, a love for life.
For the first time I understood those people that never seem to smile yet seem to find a purpose in art.
That uncle that always wears brown and dates girls that don't radiate life. That classical portrayal of Van Gogh, a person that would cut his ear off yet see
a reason to continue.

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
I spent most of the day by the table under a window. For the first time I really saw what was outside. I usually have a strong feeling of discomfort looking at the building across the street,
but today it felt new, it was unexplored territory.

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
Sometimes I would open my eyes and I would be suprised at the scene. As if I woke up in the wrong movie. As if the world reset at every blink of an eye.
I wasn't sure if I opened my eyes into the past. I would try to piece together what I did in the last few minutes and I would realize that the scenes
resembled a non-linear patchwork. As if I was jumping back and forth in the day.

      </p>

                I put a sign on the stove "Do not use before 18:00".

      <p >
                
Right when I would think it was fading out, it would get more intense. This would happen many times.

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
I remember wishing to be able to have a conversation with my sober self. Being able to compare experiences of the world.

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
The state of mind felt superior. I envied this state to myself. I wished it was always like this. What if we didn't go back?

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
For many hours I would try to write stuff but the hands would not listen. The text would be shaky or it would feel as if a force was pulling on my hand
and skewing all the text into some shape. As if I was writing against a strong wind or a magnetic field.

      </p>

A lot of time was spent thinking of the purpose of the body and whether I can exist without it. It would feel as if the world where the body is,
is not somehow special and therefore I could just disconnect from it. I knew it's a bad idea, but couldn't justificate why.
At some point I wrote down "ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT TIME IS FLOWING!". The body was where time ticks and the whole day, time was one of the only things that mattered to me.
I would later decide this would be one of the "LAWS" - a set of rules to establish before taking the drug and to follow without questioning. "Care for the body, don't kill yourself!"

      <h2 >
                Mucha
      </h2>
      


      <p >
                
Around two I started to feel a bit better. I started to flip through pages of a book of Mucha's art. Later I figured online videos of the same were more ergonomic.
For the first time I started wondering if I could try to somehow create myself. I would watch a picture and see something and then take another look only to see something completely different.
My yes would always focus just on one feature of the painting and it would cover the whole piece. I tried to capture this.
I didn't have any drawing utensils or colors so I took a pen and started sketching what I saw. At first it was a lady in a frame. Later I would notice the woman had beautiful wings.
The frame was never to be seen now. Then I noticed this tendon like connective tissue extending over her body.

      </p>
      


      <div class="gallery">
                

        <div class="gallery-img">
          <img src="./three-ways.jpg">

        <div class="gallery-img">
          <img src="./lady-wings.jpg">

        <div class="gallery-img">
          <img src="./pixie.jpg">
        </div>
        

      </div>
      


      <p >
                
By the end if you asked me what the painting depicts, I would have said it's a woman entangled in some connective tissue. The wings were gone.

      </p>
      


      <p >
                
This would repeat with other paintings.

I found peace in Monet's paintings. There was no ambiguity. Just a beach and cliffs. I drew and redrew them
until it felt like I walked those beaches myself.

It felt like I spent years by the sea. I then remembered of that far past when I would spend time with that winged lady. It felt as if it was in my youth. A lifetime ago.

I finished by drawing some kind of church. I was very pleased with the result - it far surpassed what I thought were my abilities.

      <h2 >
                A sunset
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
In the evening I had a video call with Sarah. Lately we've been barely speaking. Calls would feel like a chore.
Today I felt like I haven't felt before. There was a feeling of closeness and importance.
What I imagine a father feels like when he sees his daughter all grown up after they've been apart for 15 years.
A feeling of being glad that this other person exists, and that they have their own life. I would get emotional.
She's not used to seeing me like this. She was very tired and her eyes were closing.
I remember wanting to never forget the warm image that I saw at that moment, it was like a last sunset.
Wanting that moment to be one that I will remember on my death bed.

The whole day felt like a fight. I was glad I survived it. I knew in the future it would become easier.
I also knew I would have to get colors.
