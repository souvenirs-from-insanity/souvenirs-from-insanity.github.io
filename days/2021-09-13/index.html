In the dark, how do you know if your eyes are closed?

    </p>
    

    <p >
            
I remember sitting on my bed, and not knowing.
      <br >
      
You probably feel it in your eyelid muscles, right? But what if you have trouble making sense of most signals coming from underprivileged parts of your body?
Then you have to rely on your sight. You can look, and see if there's anything at all that you see, maybe just the dispersion of some ray that found its way into the room.
There is some undescribable difference between the black of the night and the black of your closed eyes, almost like a TV that is turned off and one that shows a black picture.
But I would try to "close my eyes really hard" and still see the same image, nothing would change. The void was just as full of life as the dark.
Will I fall asleep with my eyes open? Will I be able to fall asleep if they're closed?
Seeing 
      <i >
                nothing
      </i>
       being so real made the 
      <i >
                real
      </i>
       feel frighteningly unsure - like a memory that is from so long ago that you're not sure if it was
maybe just a dream, or maybe a story someone told you.
