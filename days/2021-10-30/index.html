                The flame that we see when we die

Imagine yourself as a machinist in an engine room.
You've been there for so long that you don't even remember what's beyond the walls of this capsule.
Every 30 minutes you have to open the mouth of the firebox and feed the hot flames new coal.
In between the feeding times you are free to try to understand and capture.
As long as you think you've fed enough coal to keep the fungus alive, the rest of your time is just about developing your understanding of how the universe works,
how light can travel across galaxies just to end up in your eyes, how tone intervals form shapes, how people think of other people, how you can be wrong even when everyone agrees with you.

                Betty the Bee
      </h2>
      


      <p >
                
There are organisms for which we don't even consider the possibility of there being an individual - something like a mold for instance.
Then there are organisms where we get fooled at first. You encounter your first bee and you're prone to giving it a name. I'm gonna call you Beatrice!
Only for you to discover a few steps later that it flew into a big hive. Do bees even have a vocabulary to talk about an individual bee?
Can one bee ask the other "how was 
        <em >
                    your
        </em>
         day?"?
Why would they? They probably have single words to express complicated group maneuvers, something like the hand-gesture signals of football players, except it's not just two or three but a whole sublanguage of them.
Populations like the mayas saw this. At some point we stopped sacrificing individuals to Gods and forgot that the death of a bee does not stop the machine.

When I take the LSD I have this feeling of deeper appreciation of the universe. I hear myself and I sound like a person lost to religion.
Is this feeling orthogonal to religion? It feels like atheist people have simply never felt this.
Religious people look like that group of friends that decided to smoke weed for the first time. Half of them don't know how to inhale properly and "maybe feel something".
A few are immediately hooked and will never stop, even if they maybe just enjoy the smoking aspect of it. Then there's the one who grabs the last little joint, smokes it all,
gets "high as a kite", just to be notified by the others that it was rolled not to waste the extra tobacco that was left and that no weed was in it.

I must imagine some primitive person had the experience - just a small temporary accidental flip in their brain - and their mind created an explanation compatible
with their language, and religion was born.

It makes me sad that my parents led an atheist life, and it makes me sad that the only alternative is to accept a religion. Especially when we all agree that none of them are true - at least not 100%.
Religious people will typically have parts of the book, for which they have their own interpretation, or parts which are just "symbolic". It feels like allegiance to a specific religion is just a percentage.
Like "I believe to 78% of what Christianity says". I feel like I would have an extremely low percentage with every religion, yet don't feel there's a need for a new one.

Being raised atheist felt somehow incredibly unfair. The fact that I could have died without seeing the structure of the universe makes me wanna scream.
I have not learned the language of life and yet I have no one to blame because at the time I would not have understood the purpose of it. Was there maybe something wrong with me?

Any act of policy, be it religion or tyranny is just someone (arrogantly?) thinking that they figured out how the fungus should run. How to make it the most healthy.
The idea of a machinist who spent most of his time painting and suddenly decides to command half the world struck me. In what context is it appropriate to ask someone "do you want to mix colors, or do you want to define the future of Europe?".

                The infinite interrogation
      </h2>
      


      <p >
                
The inner voice in my head now started to feel like an interrogation. I would pitch an idea and different figures would challenge it. Almost like a therapy sesssion (I would imagine).
Most of my recent communication with people felt like this.

Lately I'm starting to be obsessed with the consequences of a language. It is known that different langauges will lead to different brain models of the world.
I can see this everywhere. In today's world where people are so disconnected from anything that is not interpretable in terms of money we get scared by the slightest twitch, yet what do we expect
a body to do when the thought surpasses the langauge that we have?

As a child we're all convinced of our uniqueness. Everyone around you keeps reminding you of how special you are. One of the main steps of becoming an adult is to accept that we are all mostly the same.
The inability to make this leap is identified as a common cause for psychological disorders. And it's not hard to convince yourself of this. We live in a world where everything is sold in 5 sizes and color variations
that should fit everyone's needs.

But what if after puberty a reverse process started?
You started noticing that the food that they sell is not fit for you. Maybe it's the lactose, maybe it's the histamine,
none of the diagnoses explain all the issues. The doctors look at you weird. Not enough research has been done on the subject, because not enough people are affected.
Your surname is too complicated to spell out to someone and your first name is not compatible with the grammar of your language, so you just avoid using them.
Caffeine makes you feel confused but you feel an extasy that you imagine people feel on heorin, sometimes your liver will fail as a consequence of it, you start cold sweating
and you feel like you're gonna faint at any moment now, but music feels like it never did before.
Alcohol is also not the source of comfort that it is for others. You see how K seeks it as a place of refuge, but you don't understand.
The shoes that you buy are not the right shape for your feet.
People look at the fingers on your feeet and ask why do you have calcers on the knuckles?! Do you wear shoes that are too small?
The music recommendation system doesn't undertand you anymore.
You use two different accounts on Youtube, a personal one and one at work. Over time you start getting recommended on one account the videos that you watched on the other, even videos that someone sent you i.e. they don't fit your profile at all.
I can see all the bubbles in the interest vector space. One small, tiny bubble floating among them is composed of just me and my alter-ego. The big corporation patting itself on the back because of how good a job
they did finding two people with the same interests even if they don't fit the rest.
You look at people as if you had an eating disorder. Each of them has something wrong. Just like a piece of meat if you haven't seen one in a long time. This is what we eat?!
You go on vacation and you don't understand - is this supposed to be the salvation from the eternal pain of our existence?
You speedrun the race to financial independence and now you're waiting for the others. Hoping that in 10 years someone will join you. But what if you took the wrong turn at some point. What if you're where no one is gonna find you?
