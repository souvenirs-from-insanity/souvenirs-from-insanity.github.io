                A visit
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
My brother came to visit. We didn't have many plans as there was no sun in Berlin, it was cold and there were fresh news of the Omicron Covid variant.
On Friday we did a short tour of the three or four things one needs to see when they visit Berlin and Saturday we planned a journey into the depths of reality.

      </p>

We took the acid and finished cleaning up the biggest mess in my appartment when I realized I wanted to show him Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency.
I imagined he would enjoy the randomness and interconnectedness of the show. I thought it would be just a five or ten minute showcase but we were both HOOKED.
I never tried to consume stories early into the trip before. It was incredibly immersive. Every suspenseful scene got us frozen in our chairs. I could feel the
fear of the characters. Time slowed down when things got serious. We finished the first episode and I was ready to play the next one.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
My brother paused it and asked if we really want to continue watching or maybe wanted to do something else.
There was the awkward dynamic of social interactions that happens on acid, where no one feels entitled to make decisions, or doesn't want to
somehow inconvenience the other. We agreed we would each write a checklist of ideas of things we would like to do today. After all spending the whole day watching TV
is not really respectful of the drug. I had nothing, the experience of being really immersed in the show was really new, pleasurable and relaxing to me. Also I learned that
any activity leads to exhaustion and the need to do something else. He couldn't come up with anything either, but it was obvious that he didn't want to spend the whole
day in front of a screen. I broke the cycle of despair by offering him some drawing utensils.
He seemed to like the idea. I opened a booklet full of colored papers and he laughed, and said that I looked like a contraband dealer. He picked a blue sheet and lied on the floor and started drawing.

        <q >
                    I feel like everyone draws the same thing, just mandalas and other fractal geometries.
        </q>
        

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
I sat on my couch and observed what was happening. I felt a bit like a caretaker in childcare. I then lied on the couch and closed my eyes.
There was absolute freedom. A place where you could draw with silence. Every now and then I would remember that someone should check on the body, just in case
I'm lying somewhere drooling on the floor. I would come back to myself, see that everything was fine, my brother still immersed in his drawing of geometric shapes, and I would go back to my meditation.
It was hard to estimate if five minutes have passed or 5 hours so after a few of these cycles I decided to also draw something.
I knew that I would like to remember that scene so I started drawing the wooden floor. My brother would keep moving so I ended up drawing him in all the poses at the same time.
The clay pot was frustrating me a lot. I couldn't get the right feel. But the next day I looked at the drawing the the pot gives me a lot of joy. It has that texture of a garden. The colors of something
that collected the energy of the sun.

                The map of reality
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
We started talking about reality and knowledge. He had all the right questions. It was a weird feeling to see him struggle with all the same questions that I encountered myself. Only this time I was prepared.
You could see his frustration and confusion. How can we know anything for certain? What should we do when we have the possibility to do ANYTHING. Does any of those actions lead to a "purposeful"/"meaningful" life?
Can we really understand the universe? What if it's more complicated than what we can comprehend?

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
Those are all the right questions one should have in today's world. You could see in his eyes the urge to give up. Our parents did. Everyone around us has false convictions, how do I not follow?
I could tell a lot of this came from the mindset impressed in him by the CEO culture. "You should always try to find a way to automate or delegate things. A manual action is a clear indicator that you're doing something wrong.
You're doing the work of the poor." those are all teachings for a modern man that wants to escape the middle class.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
I took him to the bathroom and showed him just how deep the universe goes.

The many lights on the ceiling are reflected on the shiny surface of the ceramic sink. They all end up looking like tiny white sparks. They multiply on the many surfaces of the sink.
Now try to look into a single one of those sparks. Imagine you're trying to draw it. Capture all the qualities it has. You can focus on it and notice how the edges of it have a different color.
You can then focus INTO the spark and go deeper. See how a whole universe is hidden within? It is as if you could zoom in ad infinitum. Spend years navigating the different parts of it.

He looked enchanted. The spark is definitely deeper on LSD.

None of this should prevent you from drawing a sink though. If the task is to draw the whole sink. Getting stuck on a single spark for a year is not justified.

When our parents accepted the futility of comprehension. They effectively said that they cannot build a house because they know a carpenter and supposedly it took him years to master his craft.
That's not what I want from you. You just need to get to a point where you can build a roof over your head and a basic skeleton for further developments.

Obviously the biggest problem with understanding the universe is that we all have an aproximate understanding of how big a house is. This is not true about our surroundings.
Understanding the universe might feel like being asked to hand-draw a life-sized map of the world.
This is mostly where we've been failed in our process of education.

Just because something is infinitely deep, doesn't mean that you can't capture it.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
We can still ask whether the universe is really infinitely deep.
Imagine that you're the characther in a video game. Ideally a very simple video game. I like to immagine RollerCoaster Tycoon. You exist in a world that was described in a finite set of rules.
If time ever froze, the programmer of the game would have the ability to look at the state of the memory and tell you exactly what will happen in the next frame. Every single bit of your existence
is described by a ridiculously short piece of language.

You're effectively asking whether our universe is like this video game or not.
This is one of the questions from the family of questions that has no answer, likely never will have one and doesn't really have any significant impact on the existence of anyone.
You will encounter more of such questions and will learn to accept them as such.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
All the other questions he had were human questions. They wouldn't exist if humans didn't exist.
And the only way to understand those is to understand what a human is - what its ultimate goals are.
What followed was an explanation of the fungus of humanity. At the end there was the look of a person who's been failed by ideas too many times.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
I was really trying to get across that most questions that one has, have been explored in the past. And that even if they don't 
        <em >
                    fully
        </em>
         capture reality. They are increasingly more detailed inspections of what reality looks like.
This (the sciences) is in contrast with some streams of ideas that don't converge to a single image - the biggest offenders being the like of non-religious spiritualism - the kind that I tend to see in psychonauts.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
I am lately thinking a lot about convergence. What if we saw all our observations as points on a lattice. Slowly building a more complex understanding of what is a single point somewhere on the top.

While drawing he got repeatedly frustrated that the geometries he saw were constantly changing.
Somehow it led to me talking about features. It was a great example of math really helping you make a better sense of the experience.
In math they observed that a lot of 
        <i >
                    things
        </i>
         have similar properties. You can take a sequence of three numbers and add them together,
and the order in which you perform the additions doesn't matter - `4 + (3 + 7) = 14 = (4 + 3) + 7`. Mathematicians called this property the law of associativity. But then we notice
this applies to other things as well. Let's consider strings of text and their concatenation. The same law applies - `"cat" ++ ("dog" ++ "cow") = "catdogcow" = ("cat" ++ "dog") + "cow"`.
Now, from this law more knowledge can be formulated but it will be true about both numbers and strings of text. Ideally we would like to study something to which the
associativity law applies, but that doesn't necessarily have the other properties a number or a string of text have.
In our world we might observe that a table has a sharp edge on it and a box of chalks also has an edge. You will start to learn things that are true about the edge regardless of where the edge is located.
What you want to talk about is an abstract edge - an edge that is not on a table and it's not on a box of chalks. A divine edge with just the properties that are shared among all the edges.
Mathematicians give this abstract object that satisfies the associativity law a 
        <em >
                    name
        </em>
        , they call it a "Semigroup".
I believe that these more abstract concepts are what we see during a trip. The higher layers of a neural network representing these learned abstractions firing sometimes randomly. This is what ends up
materializing in our head things that when you start drawing them from the center and go left they will have most attributes of a horse and when you go right it will seem to have more in common with a toaster.

      <p >
                
We also talked how much power individuals have in today's world and how we're failing to educate them appropriately.
It very much feels like one of those evolutionary paths of an organism where a muscle grows too big for the rest of the body to sustain it.
Like the giraffes that grew an even longer neck, but then had trouple pumping blood all the way up there.
I am more sceptical that humanity will be able to overcome this fight rather than the fight on global warming.
