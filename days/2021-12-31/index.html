The trip was not great this time. I'm inclined to blame the bad food we ate the days prior, but I can't be sure - which really annoys me.

I was lying in bed kind of dissociated when I started having weird thoughts that I haven't seen described in the media before.
I don't remember what the thought was but a fear struck me. What if I'm having the thoughts people have right before dying?
Such stories would never be told. I remembered about survivorship bias.

I was drawing an airpline when it started to look like an alpha cat with a cigar.

        <q >
                    I have a great idea!
        </q>
         I exclaimed and got K's attention.
Cat girls! but make it "I want pictures of spiderman!".
Then I spent a significant amount of time searching reference pictures under the keywords "muscular chest hair"
eager to see just how gay the adds on my account are gonna be in the next few weeks.

I had an episode of those completely random conspiracy theories running in my head.
I looked at the album cover of Hunky Dory and noticed the hands did not have a very defined structure.


        <div class="gallery">
                    

          <div class="gallery-img">

It seemed as if you could decide whether the lower arm was coming from the right or the bottom. The two hands led me to belive that
there must be 2,4,8,..? possible sets of hands.
I started seeing multiple people in his face depending on which hands I considered. Some were more masculine others feminine.
I was fighting to see all the possibilities and in the struggle I tried to communicate it to K who looked at me with a face of obviousness.
He was basically asking me if I finally see it. I realized it was a test of acceptance. "Do you finally see that everyone has a trans person inside? and do you therefore accept that you yourself are trans?"
the whole world was waiting for my acknowledgment - as if being trans was yet another religion. It felt inevitable as if not agreeing was just postponing a future acceptance.
The boredom in K's face eminated a confidence that is not common among spreaders of ideologies yet I felt pressured. I felt the pressure of "others" as if there was a whole group
waiting for his report. The atmosfere started to resemble the final scenes of a historical movie about nazism. The parts where 98% of life revolves around the presence of Nazis in society.
I couldn't imagine what the rest of the day would be if not an escape from this regime. It was at this point that I realized life used to not be like this.
That this must be something close to a dream. I tried to shortly distract myself with other things around the room. Soon I realized that it was yet another conspiracy theory
completely imagined on the spot.
I then spent the following thirty minutes trying to engage K into some conversations just to not be left alone with my thoughts.

It is wildly fascinating to me that the brain comes up with completely random stories in which you are the victim of evil inflicted by people who you otherwise consider to be close people to you.
It would be easy to dismiss if it was a phenomenon existing only on drugs, but I've observed this on old people and there's no reason to believe that it is not an part of everyday life for some people with the right brain chemistry.
I consider this empathy towards conspiracy-theorists to be one of the greatest gifts LSD has brought me.

At the end of the day I retold this story to K who said he had no idea any of this was happening. His annoyed face was mostly a result of failing to understand what I was saying
and he was very grateful that he didn't know about this during the trip.
