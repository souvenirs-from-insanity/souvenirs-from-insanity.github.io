      <h2 >
                A bit of reflection
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
Most of the entries in this journal are summaries of single experiences. They can often contradict each other by the simple nature of this drug.
The most significant initial effect is a complete alternation of your context. Memories, personality, points of view.
It is for this reason that I'd like to spend some time today to reflect on the year as a whole. Try to distill what the different sessions had in common and and what the consequences on the unjournaled life are.

      </p>
      


      <h2 >
                Should people try it?
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
The obvious question in this context is "would you do it again? / would you reccomend it to someone else?".
I do wish there was a more comprehensive list of effects that one can expect when taking LSD.
The content on the internet seems to usally suggest that the only risks of LSD are 1) HPPD and 2) the behaviors of the individual caused by the drug.
In my experience this does not paint a good picture of what it's actually like.

      </p>
      

      <h3 >
                Physical danger
      </h3>
      

      <p >
                
I have heard many stories of LSD triggering really unpredictable behavior in individuals. One such story comes from a very close circle of acquaintances. A moderately experienced user took a higher dose
than he was used to and suddenly he was left with no sight. This person panicked and started throwing random objects that he could reach because according to him, the noises of the objects
hitting walls were the only thing that his eyes could perceive. Three people had to hold him down until the police arrived. There are also various stories of people trying to fly (typically involving windows on higher floors).
I like to believe that those stories are enough for me to be cautious of any physical activity especially ones triggered by paranoia or panic, but I guess it would take many more trips to be able to judge.
Somehow related to physical danger is the whole subject of extreme paranoia. And it's not the paranoia that one experiences on weed, where one gets the impression that the police might be right outside the house.
In the case of LSD the brain gets into extremely sophisticated conspiracy theories, often involving people in the same room. I think I'm getting better at detecting those situations, but definitely something I was initally not prepared for.

      </p>
      

      <h3 >
                HPPD
      </h3>
      

      <p >
                
HPPD is presented as a common side effect of LSD and it's portrayed as a condition with long-term negative effects.
It is not clear to me which of my post-trip experiences are direct consequences of HPPD (if any of them) but I definitely experience altered perception throughout daily life (the first trip was an exception in this regard as I didn't notice anything interesting until the second trip).
What was unexpected is how different the experience of these symptoms is compred to how HPPD is typically described.
From my experience the long-term side effects of LSD don't really feel like occasional hallucinatory attacks but rather a persistent alteration in how one perceives the world.
It doesn't feel like you see something on top of your normal perception but rather as if you were robbed of how your eyes used to see.
The most obvious one is visual artifacts.
It feels a bit like the difference between how the general public sees a movie and how cinematographers see it.
For the public a lens flare is just an emotional trigger, something that is perceived subconsciously but the cinematographer will see it and get distracted from the plotline. They will start to think about the choice of lighting and gear that led to it.
I can feel like I am more disturbed by the shadows of silhouettes burnt into my retina as I look around.
When I close my eyes I can read the noise that is presented to me. I used to assume it to be silence, but not anymore.
Now I can see all the imbalances in intensity of light that the eyes experienced before I hid them behind my eyelids and the traces that it's trying to predict on moving objects.
It's not really something that one has to put effort in, it just becomes part of everyday reality.

      </p>
      

      <h3 >
                Sleep
      </h3>
      

      <p >
                
One thing that I feel goes completely unadressed is the alteration to sleep.
It should not come as a surprise but LSD and sleep definitely affect each other.
The basic effect that I think anyone can experience is simply the chaos that will happen in your head when you try to fall asleep.
It is hard to describe and I can't tell if this was maybe the case even before LSD (typically caused by caffeine), but falling asleep involves a lot of very random thoughts that are hard to tame.
After the first few trips I temporarily (~1 week) lost the ability to normally fall asleep. I would lay down and try to calm down my mind as usual and it felt as if you were walking and someone led you by holding your hand to make sure that you didn't stop. Synthetic wakefulness.
Even if you do fall asleep waking up in the middle of the night and paying a visit to the toilet now involves seeing a darkness full of galaxies and geometric shapes.
Those hallucinations are very different from the LSD ones, they seem to match more what people describe one sees on DMT but those also don't help to then fall asleep again.
Then there is probably the biggest negative effect that I have experienced and wasn't at all pepared for.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
After the second or third session I had a very surreal experience. It was a week when I was having trouble falling asleep. I was laying already for a few hours, I suspect it was close to 4am when out of boredom I was scrolling through twitter on my phone.
Suddenly I realized that I can feel my sleeping mask pressing around my head and I realized someting was not right. How could I be looking at my phone's screen while having a sleeping facemask on? It was clear to me this was some kind of sleeping state
but I knew in which position I was laying and I was aware of my surroundings. I didn't want to look away from the screen because I didn't want to break the experience. I was fascinated by how real the content on the screen was.
I tried to read the tweets and it posed no problem. And the content didn't feel like something that I've seen before. Some of them were in languages I didn't understand, some had images I could not imagine. It was as real as things can be.
It should be noted that the hallucination didn't resemble anything experienced under LSD (those hallucinations don't really try to impersonate reality but rather distort it somehow) and I have never had any experience with lucid dreaming or similar phenomena before.
At this point things started getting loud and I started feel something going over my whole body. Something like a sneeze or goose bumps but more "electric". It had that cartoonish frequency of electricity. It was "loading" until it discharged right in my head.
It was very scary. I assumed I had my first epileptic attack. The following days I felt very tired and a bit shook.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
The next week I tried to internalize what could have happened and what could have been the cause of it (a second suspect was the fixative spray that I recently started using on the pastel drawings).
I paid a visit to my general practicioner and was lucky to find a very friendly young doctor who was very open to hearing the whole story and tried to calm me down in the first place.
He explained that what I was experiencing was definitely not epilepsy and that psychadelics can have unexpected effects. He also reassured me that the fixative is definitely innocent in this case.
He suggested that I should give some time to my brain to learn to fall asleep again and get used to the new conditions and suggested some sleeping pills for the first few days.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
The sleeping pills did initially help and later the sleeping did get better. The electric-shock-like experiences sometimes accompanied by lucid-dream-like experiences happened a few more times even though the shocks decreased in intensity and often bear no consequences.
I now sometimes force them when I can feel them coming, just to get over them faster.
After some google searches and reddit "consultations" I found out about "brain zaps", which is a drug withdrawal symptom of some antidepressants. It does seem to match in all aspects my experience.

      </p>
      

      <h3 >
                The good
      </h3>

      <p >
                
All these negative effects have obviously not discouraged me from regularly re-immersing myself in the exprience so it should be obvious that I did experience a lot of positive effects as well.
It should be disclosed that my first dose was taken as some sort of last attempt in finding a reason to continue in life. It is not the scope of this entry so I won't go into details ...
At first it did serve this purpose very well. It did feel a lot like finally receiving that letter from Hogwarts that we were all waiting for. Feeling like the world is indeed more than
what people try to make you believe. For the first time in my life I looked into the painting and felt a connection. What's more, the activity of reasoning about things flowers into something
tangible here. It is as if patterns of obvervations could be applied to any other input. You will look at your relationships and see the formula that governs them.
Camus would approve of the drug. One small piece of paper and in an afternoon you experience the whole lifetime of our planet and see it through the eyes of people that you before hated.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
For a period of time it felt like this is a new calling, a new purpose of life. You will have that feeling that an exchange student experiences when they have to go back and realize they can't.
I do think at some point one has to realize there are many stories that warn us against this. It would indeed be a life spent in front of a Mirror of Erised.
A lazy life empty of responsibility like the one that the generation before us had.
I also think that even if someone wanted to, they could not take the drug often enough to hide themselves from reality constantly.

        <br >
        
(I do realize Harry Potter is not a good source of parables, and I do apologize for not having better ones :D)

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
I would definitely not call my despair with the reality of life a resolved matter, but I do somehow whish I could find a way to observe more of the cosmic beauty.
So if nothing else LSD has bought me some time.

                Other changes
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
People often talk about radical personal transformations triggered by LSD.
It is really hard to tell if I experienced any. There is a certain incredulity into one's own memories that one gains after their first trip (hence why I'm writing this journal).
I feel somehow validated in my idea that it makes sense to try to understand the patterns that surround us and it showed me that they go much deeper than I understood before.
But I can imagine other people will validate their own beliefs on LSD.
The drug certainly gave me a deeper understanding of what it means to be happy. I would sometimes spend an entire afternoon immersed in the light reflected from a bowl of blueberries
and at the end of it feel exhausted but satisfied. A feeling that I have not experienced in a long time.
I would describe it as a concentrated version of the feeling of wisdom and accomplishment that you have when you finish a book.

      </p>

                Chemistry
      </h3>
      

      <p >
                
I have learned a better vocabulary for the states of the head. It does feel like a superpower to experience a dopamine overload for a moment.
It's like that moment when you for the first time taste a spice and you realize it was always in that meal that your mother used to prepare for you. That flavor now means something different to you.
Before, you could only tell that other people's versions of the same meal were just missing that something special. But next time you will taste your mother's meal you will know it's there. It's like penetrating the arabic alphabet for the first time.
Distinguishing words in what used to be gibberish.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
It also made it much easier to stop using alcohol and caffeine. It really doesn't feel anymore like those are really substances that enhance the human experience.

      </p>
      

      <h3 >
                Cadence
      </h3>
      

      <p >
                
I'm still not even close to understanding how often I want or should take it. Taking it too often implies a significant disruption to long-term life goals (whatever that means for me right now),
but when I don't take it for a long time (&gt;1.5 months) there is some feeling of rejection within me. I come back and the other voices within me treat me like a son that only shows up when he's in need of money.
I end up feeling like a tourist in my own universe.

      </p>
      

      <h3 >
                Body acceptance
      </h3>
      

      <p >
                
I still feel like a weird member of society (societies?).
Under LSD I experience a better framework for thinking about this. For the first time I had a clear mental model for the lack of connection between me and the rest of the network - I could see myself like a free electron floating along a semiconductor lattice.
It is still not clear to me whether this in the long-term will lead to more connections or further alienation. These experiences are not really orthogonal to my other individualistic activities and so it's hard to attribute effects.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
I have a lot of weird digestion problems (confirmed by doctors) that are hard to treat other than to follow strict unclear diets. I distinctly remember when I was outside with K on a walk and I felt a sharp pain in my digestive tract
and my exact thought was "you should really start taking care of your body better because we can't really enjoy more trips otherwise". It did force me a bit to control myself more in terms of food. Not completely, but there is noticable improvement.

      </p>
      

      <h3 >
                Dementia
      </h3>
      

      <p >
                
I think that in moments when it gets too intense the symptoms seems to resemble dementia and it convinced me quite firmly that as an elderly person I don't want to live through it.
It is a terrible fate. Infinite confusion with no vision of a future improvement. I don't understand why we would not accept death under such circumstances.
More generally you get to see death very differently under the influence. It feels like a very rational choice. So rational that I had to set a rule to myself to simply not kill myself
under the influence. It would be just too easy. And the reasoning would not have to be sound at all.

      </p>
      

      <p >
                
When I take LSD my thought process starts to resemble a group conversation, I don't really hear other voices. The structure of my thoughts is more reminiscent of the one I have
in a group context. There is almost a roomy resonance in the conversation. It's also not like multiple personality disorder as it doesn't feel like the different MEs have their own identity.
It's more like different aspects of me. A decomposition of what I am, if you will.
I am growing some kind of fascination with different mental disorders that share symptoms with LSD even if I understand that they will typically represent an indeterminate sentence to torture.

                Conclusion
      </h2>
      

      <p >
                
It is really hard to judge whether other people should experience it. It is very tempting to give it to everyone you know. But I can see how realising late in your life
that you went the wrong way would just result in a lot of pain, maybe it's just better to let the engine finish running.
It is also hard not to fall into patronizing behaviors when it's clear that there are dangers with radical mental transformations and increased susceptability to being radicalized yet we ourselves feel "qualified" enough to face them.
I think my isolation and lack of culture/religion/strong family connections left me in a relatively safe playground of exploration, which I imagine is not a luxury that everyone would have,
but maybe it's also just a lie that I tell myself.
